1. I learned a lot about pointers as well as file IO.

2. In task 3 it was difficult to understand what should go where. I thought I was supposed to put pointers as arguments and not just the memory address of
a, b and c. So I called the function with (p1, p2, p3, bool) instead of (&a, &b, &c, bool) at first. I overcame it by asking in the class Discord, they gave
me other perspectives which made me see the error of my ways.

3. Dunno. It was a pretty good lab I'd say.

Estimated time: ~10 hours
